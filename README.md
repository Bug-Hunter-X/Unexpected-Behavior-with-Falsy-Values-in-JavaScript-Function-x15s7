# Unexpected Behavior with Falsy Values in JavaScript Function

This repository demonstrates a common, yet subtle, error in JavaScript function handling of falsy values. The original code attempts to handle `null` values correctly, but it doesn't address other falsy values such as `0`, `false`, or `""`.

## Bug Report
The `foo` function in `bug.js` is designed to add two numbers, but it only explicitly checks for `null` inputs. When passed other falsy values it returns `null` instead of performing the addition. This might lead to unexpected results in applications relying on the correct sum of numerical values.

## Solution
The `bugSolution.js` file provides a solution that uses strict equality (`===`) to check against `null` and employs a loose equality (`==`) to check for other falsy values. It ensures numerical addition or returns null only for strict null values.  This approach provides a more robust solution to the issue.
